- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 10.8.3 or higher)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D-Stories.git
   cd 3D-Stories
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. To build under a specific path, e.g. `/3dstories` you also need to specify the full base url in the `VITE_URL` variable:

   ```bash
   VITE_URL=https://your-domain/3dstories  npm run build -- --base=/3dstories
   ```

4. Preview:

   ```bash
   npm run preview -- --base=/3dstories
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Features

- **Animated Storyline**: Animation of 3D objects based on a narrative that guides the user through the object's details.
- **Visual Consistency**: Link your presentation to a preferable position, rotation, or scale of the 3D/2D objects.
- **Flexible Navigation**:
  - Scrolling
  - Points of interest (the model exploration mode).
  - Fullscreen menu navigation
- **Orbit Tool**: Use the orbit tool to explore the 3D Model from different angles (Rotate, Zoom Out/In (Scale), Move).
- **Multiple Objects**: Animate and explore multiple objects within a single story.
- **Modal Windows**: Modal windows provide additional images and information related to the text.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Applications Used

- **React Vite**: For building a fast and modern web application.
- **React Three Fiber**: For rendering 3D graphics using Three.js in React.
- **Theatre JS**: For animation and interactive experiences.
- **Blender**: For converting 3D Models to glb/gltf format.
